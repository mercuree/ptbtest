# (In) compatibility
Unfortunately lately this testsuite has not been updated to any versions of python-telegram-bot higher than 6.0. Hopefully some time can be spent to update it soon.

# ptbtest
## a testsuite for [Python telegram bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/)

This library is meant for people wanting to write unittests for their python-telegram-bot driven bots.
The following things make this library attractive to create unittests
* Mockbot - A fake bot that does not contact telegram servers
* Works with the updater from telegram.ext
* Generatorclasses to easily create Users, Chats and Updates.

Read the [documentation](http://ptbtestsuite.readthedocs.io/en/master/?badge=master) for further reading and check out the examples.
